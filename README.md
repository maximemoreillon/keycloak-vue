# Keycloak + Vue

This repository is based on https://github.com/achernetsov/vue-keycloak-template

NOTE: It is recommended to use a generic OIDC client rather than that of Keycloak for improved compatibility with other authentication services such as Auth0.
A simple repository for such implementation is available [here](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/oidc-vue)
